          <h2>Slack Live Chat</h2>
          <p>
            Chatbots are of course very smart, and have an answer for almost
            everything. But there are also situations where a chatbot should
            better hand over the conversation to a real person. We at Apptiva
            mostly use slack channels for live chats. Therefore it was obvious
            to integrate Slack in a simple way with Bubble CMS.
          </p>
          <p>
            When creating an intent, the user can now select a so-called "Slack
            Expert Intent". When this intent is triggered, the chatbot will
            start a conversation with the previously configured slack channel.

          <h2>Entity based intents</h2>
          <p>
            This title may sound a bit more complicated than the actual thing
            is. Often chatbots need to be able to give different answers based
            on a parameter. If, for example, a chatbot from a large company is
            asked: "How much do I earn during my apprenticeship?", it usually
            cannot give an answer right away. The chatbot must first ask which
            apprenticeship it is about.
          </p>
          <p>
            With entity based intents, Bubble CMS can be configured to do just
            that. At first, an entity such as "Apprenticeship" needs to be
            created. Afterwards, a prompt can be defined for a "Salary" intent,
            which in this case could be like: "What apprenticeship are you
            interested in?‚Äù Finally, a suitable answer can be entered for all
            entity values.

          <h2>Markdown</h2>
          <p>
            Text-based responses are great. But sometimes it's good if you can
            integrate a link in an answer, or maybe even display an image. For
            this reason we have integrated the use of Markdown in answer
            bubbles. In addition to images and links, the answers can be
            formatted as desired.
