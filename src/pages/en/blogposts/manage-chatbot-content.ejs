        <h2>Chatbot maintenance can be a pain</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            A chatbot that answers a few simple questions needs hardly any
            maintenance. However, if a chatbot project is a bit larger, you
            often encounter the same following questions from customers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How can a marketing employee train the chatbot?</li>
            <li>
              Where do we see what the chatbot didnâ€™t understand? And how do we
              teach this to the chatbot?
            </li>
            <li>
              How do we make sure that the chatbot answers the original
              questions correctly after additional training?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            One might think that these questions have been solved a long time
            ago. But far from it: The currently existing solutions barely cover
            these problems. In most cases, they are also too technical for your
            average employee.

        <h2>Bubble CMS</h2>
        <p>
          We decided to solve these problems with Bubble CMS, a chatbot content
          management system. During the chatbot projects of the past years, we
          learned a lot about the needs of our customers. Bubble CMS is a
          cohesive solution to the problems described above.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bubble CMS addresses among other things the following needs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the CMS, not-IT personell can train the chatbot with intents and
            the corresponding answers. No technical know-how is necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            The training for different departments takes place independently of
            each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            You get a clear overview of utterances that the chatbot did not
            understand. These can be used to train the chatbot.
          </li>
          <li>
            A set of test questions can be defined to ensure the functioning of
            the chatbot at all times.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can track individual changes and you have the possibility to
            roll them back.
          </li>
        </ul>
